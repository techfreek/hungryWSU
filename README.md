hungryWSU
=========

This was the first 'real' website I ever made. I had messed around with websites in the past, but never going beyond basic HTML and CSS. This was the first time I ever worked with PHP, Javascript (for the most part), and databases. 

I apologize if the code is really sloppy, it was hacked together. It proved to be an excellent mvp (minimum viable product) as I re-wrote the idea as ishungry.co which takes the concept and scales it up to the entire united states.
